# Auth 

Auth is just a practice repo, its just meant to be a practice project about authentication and authorization using a backend made with Express.js and builinding a 
simple API that consumes data from a cloud hosted DB at MongoAtlas and some endpoints validate that the user atempting to get the resources had already authenticated
and has the right roles to be elegible to access the requested data.

That's it 😁
